This week was about discovering tools to measure community metrics ðŸ“Š.

Yes, community metrics is a thing and is an entire subject!

Me and my team at Zalando in the OpenSource team were trying to setup a tool from this [list](https://github.com/todogroup/guides/blob/master/tools-for-managing-open-source-programs.md) which would best measure all
our defined KPIs.

Unfortunatey, none of these tools worked. They were either too painful to setup and run which would mean hard on maintenance in the long run or they just didn't work.

On the 3rd day of the week we tried to write our very own tool to extract, load and transform the Github data. Towards the end of the week we had pretty much an MVP!

[Here](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/roadblock) is the repo.
