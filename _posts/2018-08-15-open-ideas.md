I am volunteering as a Wrangler for Mozfest 2018 and have been curating proposals for MozFest Openness Space.

We have received a large no. of proposals and it's been great fun reading through lot of new ideas and ultimately the decisions have been really tough.

- The first round is a blind voting process (Done)
- The second round is a group voting process
  (ongoing)

If you want to follow and get inspiration from Open ideas, here they are: https://github.com/MozillaFestival/mozfest-program-2018/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BSecondary+Space%5D+Openness%22

Have fun!
