As I was wondering what to publish for my weekly post, I just discovered this Github Emoji cheat sheet - https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/.

I must admit that I didn't bother to search for a cheat sheet earlier.
I am glad I did this today and I have a weekly post. Yayy!!! ðŸŽ‰

I always use to mess up with the codes, or end up being frustrated not to find the emoji I wanted.
Worst, I used to write `:)` when I actually wanted `:blush:` this ðŸ˜Š. It's only today that I learned this emoji is called `blush`!!!

I use this website - https://emojipedia.org/ in general to find emoji codes.

Happy OpenWorld Friday ðŸ’–
