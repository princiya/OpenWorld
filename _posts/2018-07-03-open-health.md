I attended [LibrePlanet 2018](https://www.libreplanet.org/2018/program/) earlier this year in Boston.

There was a panel discussion on [Freedom, Health & Devices](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/freedom-devices-and-health/) which was very insightful. This drove my attention to the range of possibilities / learnings / research and innovation around ethics, best practices and privacy related to health & technology.

The panel discussion also featured an interesting DIY project called [OpenAPS](https://openaps.org/). The Open Artificial Pancreas System project - (OpenAPS) is an open and transparent effort to make safe and effective basic Artificial Pancreas System (APS) technology widely available to more quickly improve and save as many lives as possible and reduce the burden of Type 1 diabetes.
