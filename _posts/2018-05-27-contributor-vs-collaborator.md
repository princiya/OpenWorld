This week was about polishing [Roadblock](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/roadblock), a Node.js based application to measure community metrics ðŸ“Š.

At one point, we wanted endpoints to measure Zalando's contributions to external Open Source projects, and external contributors contributing to Zalando's projects. ðŸ™„

This is when I was eager to how a Contributor differed from a Collaborator. ðŸ¤·

**Contributor**: A person from the outside not on the core development team of the project that wants to contribute some changes to a project.

**Collaborator**: A person on the core development team of the project and has commit access to the main repository of the project.
